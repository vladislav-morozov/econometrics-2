# Advanced Econometrics (Econometrics II)

This repository contains the lecture materials and supporting content for the undergraduate course *Advanced Econometrics (Econometrics II)* that I offered at the University of Bonn.

The course builds on foundational econometrics and expands in three primary directions: the difference between causal inference and forecasting, introducing further empirical methods, and deeper theoretical underpinnings of econometric techniques. It is designed for students with prior exposure to basic statistics and econometrics. The empirical illustrations are implemented in Python.

## Course Information

**Instructor:** Vladislav Morozov 
**Course Website:** <https://vladislav-morozov.github.io/econometrics-2/>

**Level:** Undergraduate
**Prerequisites:** Prior coursework in statistics and econometrics

**Current course status**: In progress, these materials get updated regularly

## Course Overview

The course is structured around five major components (subject to change):

1. **Linear Regression â€“ A Deeper Look**
   Vector-matrix representation and asymptotics for the OLS estimator
   
2. **Asymptotic inference**
   Basic notions, $t$- and Wald tests, the delta method 

3. **Panel Data Methods for Causal Inference**
   Event studies, difference-in-differences, fixed effects with multivalued treatment
4. **Forecasting**
   Foundations of forecast evaluation, cross-sectional and time series forecasting methods.

5. **Nonlinear Models**
   Nonlinear least squares, discrete choice models, asymptotic theory, and classification.

6. **Additional Topics (Time Permitting)**
   Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), time series models (ARIMA, VAR), and causality in time series.

Even further topics such as quantile regression, experimentation under interference, and high-dimensional data may be introduced as time allows.

## Course Materials

The course draws from a range of textbooks. Relevant chapters are indicated within the lecture slides.

## Assessment

Final evaluation is based on a 90-minute written, closed-book exam. The course offers ungraded problem sets.
