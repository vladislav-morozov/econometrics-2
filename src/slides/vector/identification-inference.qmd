### Identification and Inference {background="#43464B"}

#### Overall Goal

Goal of all of statistics:

<br> 

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; padding: 9px; border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

"Say something" about a "parameter" of interest "based on data"

</div>

<br>

Which "parameter"? What is "something"?  How much "data"?


#### Parameters of Interest

Which parameter you want depends on the context: 

- Causal settings: 
  - Treatment effects: averages, variances, ... 
  - Features of structural economic models: elasticities, multipliers, ...
- Prediction: some value of interest -
  - Forecast of GDP, ...
  - Whether the patient has a disease ...
  
#### Identification vs. Inference

What about the "something" and the "data"? 

. . . 


## Identification and Inference {background="#00100F"}
  
### Broad Goals {background="#43464B"}


####

Two kinds of statistical work: 

1. <span class="highlight">Identification</span>: what could we learn if we had an infinite amount of data?
2. <span class="highlight">Inference</span>: how to "learn" from limited data? 

. . .

Both equally important in causal settings. Identification less/not important in prediction

#### Goal of Estimation 

In prediction, also care: how uncertain are we about our prediction? 

In prediction, there are two  sources of uncertainty 

#### Motivation 

"Identification strategy" refers to imposing some assumptions

It is a fundamentally theoretical exercise

#### 

Identification is the property of the model

Something you do with "sample" arguments

Sometimes you do it with 

@Lewbel2019IdentificationZooMeanings




@Wooldridge2020IntroductoryEconometricsModern defines identification directly as being able to estimate it consistently

- Good definition for practice - if we cannot, then what use is the parameter? 


#### 

Linear model: if not unique, the other models give the same 


#### Non-Identifcation

You have to show an actual example of different values of $\theta$ that give the same observed distribution.

Not sufficient to show that a particular strategy fails
