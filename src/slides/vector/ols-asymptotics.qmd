### Motivation {background="#43464B"}

#### Goal

inference 

- Quantify uncertaintY: confidence intervals
- Test something


#### Reminder: 

normality


#### Issue with Normality

But normality

Example: positive outcomes and positive regressors: how can $U_{it}$ be normal?

#### Issue: Unknown Distribution

Normality was useful? 

If we knew some other distribution, would be nice

But we cannot 

#### Options

- Nonasymptotic/finite-sample analysis based on "high-probability bounds" --- popular  
- Large-sample "approximations" using tools like the central limit theorem(s) --- topic of this lecture
