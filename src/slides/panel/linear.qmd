Goal — understand estimation approaches

- What if we apply the same to more general $\bX_{it}$? Can we generalize?

####



#### Slide

Start a bit different — with an estimator and understanding what it does

Other specifications

- Unit-level
- No random intercepts — pooled OLS
- More complicated combinations

#### Terminology: FE vs. RE vs. CRE

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}

This terminology is confusing. Best to always say what you mean (e.g. "no restriction on the dependence between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bX_{it}$" or "random intercept")
