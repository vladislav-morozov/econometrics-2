### Motivation and Questions {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}


#### Reminder: TWFE

Recall: for difference-in-differences showed that
$$ \small
\widehat{ATT}^{DiD} = \hat{\delta}
$$
where $\hat{\delta}$ was the OLS estimator in regression
$$\small
Y_{i2}- Y_{i1} = \gamma + \delta D_{it} + U_{i2}
$$ {#eq-panel-twfe-did-diff}
for $\delta$ --- the ATT;  $\gamma$ --- average change in outcomes (trend)

#### Reminder: More General Equation

@eq-panel-twfe-did-diff obtained by differencing the *two-way fixed effect* equation:
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta D_{it} + U_{it},
$$ {#eq-panel-twfe-did-undiff}
where 
$$
\gamma_1 = 0, \quad \gamma_2 = \gamma
$$
and $\alpha_i = Y_{i1}^0$ --- baseline differences between units

#### Reminder: Estimation

<br> 

- We know how to apply OLS based on @eq-panel-twfe-did-diff: just regress $(Y_{i1}, Y_{i2})$ on $(1, D_{it})$ with OLS
- Last time said that can also apply OLS based on @eq-panel-twfe-did-undiff directly (e.g. `PanelOLS` from `linearmodels`)
  - Treated $\alpha_i$ as <span class="highlight"> parameters </span> 
  - Got exactly the same results from two approaches


#### Lecture Questions


1. How to apply OLS on @eq-panel-twfe-did-undiff? 
  - What are the regressors? How to "treat $\alpha_i$ as parameters"?
  - How does it work in practice?
  - Is the estimator inspired by @eq-panel-twfe-did-undiff always equal to the one based on @eq-panel-twfe-did-diff?
2. Can we apply the same approach with general (not just 0/1) treatment? What are the causal properties?
  

## Fixed Effect Estimation {background="#00100F"}

 

### Random Intercept (Fixed Effect) Models {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}
 
#### First Goal: Vector-Matrix Representation

First question: "treating $\alpha_i$ as parameters"?

. . .

<br>


For now forget about $D_{it}$ and $\gamma$ and consider:
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + U_{it}, \quad i=1,\dots, N; t=1, \dots, T
$$ {#eq-panel-twfe-simplified-ind-intercept}
$\alpha_i$ — individual-specific intercept. Data assumed balanced (same $T$ for all units)

<br>


Want to represent @eq-panel-twfe-simplified-ind-intercept in vector-matrix form

#### Vector-Matrix Forms for Panel Data I

Before that: more info on matrix forms for panel data.

. . . 

<br>

Vector form as before: single observation (now fixed $i$ and $t$) with vector of covariates: 
$$
Y_{it} = \bX_{it}'\bbeta + U_{it}
$$

#### Vector-Matrix Forms for Panel Data II

Two key matrix forms:

- Individual level. Let $\bY_i = (Y_{i1}, \dots, Y_{iT})$, $\bX_i = (\bX_{i1}, \dots, \bX_{iT})'$, then
$$
\bY_i = \bX_i\bbeta + \bU_i
$$


- Full sample. Let $\bY = (\bY_1, \dots, \bY_N)$, $\bX= (\bX_1', \dots, \bX_N')'$. Then 
$$
\bY = \bX\bbeta + \bU
$$

#### Individual Matrix Form with Individual Intercepts

<br> 

Model ([-@eq-panel-twfe-simplified-ind-intercept]) in individual matrix form:
$$
\bY_i = \alpha_i \mathbf{1}_T + \bU_i
$$
where $\mathbf{1}_T$ — $T$-vector of ones 

. . .

<br> 

Not that insightful

#### Full Sample Matrix Form with Individual Intercepts

Model ([-@eq-panel-twfe-simplified-ind-intercept]) in full sample matrix form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bY & = \bF \bLambda + \bU, \\
\bLambda & = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N)', \\
\bF & =  \bI_N \otimes \mathbf{1}_T,
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-panel-twfe-one-way-matrix-form}
where $\otimes$ is the [Kronecker product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product). Intuition: 

- There are $N$ regressors, $i$th regressor is the dummy of being the $i$th unit (0/1 regressor values)
- $\bLambda$ --- associated parameter vector

#### More Complex Example: Two-Way Intercept Model

Now consider more general model:
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + U_{it}
$$
Here want to treat both $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_t$ as parameters

. . . 

<br>

Individual matrix form:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bY_i & = \alpha_i \mathbf{1}_T + \bI_T \bgamma + \bU_i\\
\bgamma & = (\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_T)'
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Two-Way Model: Full Sample Matrix Form

Can write
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bY & = \bF\bLambda + \bU, \\
\bF & =  \left(\bI_N \otimes \mathbf{1}_T, \mathbf{1}_N\otimes \bI_T \right)\\ 
\bLambda & = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N, \gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_T)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Both $\alpha_{\cdot}$ and $\gamma_{\cdot}$ treated as parameters
- Regressors in $\bF$: $N$ dummy regressors from before; $T$ new dummy regressors, $t$th new regressors — indicator of $t$th period

#### Adding Other Covariates

Can write @eq-panel-twfe-did-undiff as
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \bX_{it}'\bbeta + U_{it},
$$
for $\bX_{it} = (D_{it})$ and $\bbeta = (\delta)$

. . .

<br>

Its matrix form is 
$$
\bY = \bF\bLambda + \bX\beta + \bU
$$

#### Random-Intercept (Fixed Effects) Models

<div class="rounded-box">

::: {#def-panel-twfe-fe-model}

Models of the kind
$$ \small
\bY = \bF\bLambda +\bX\bbeta + \bU,
$$ {#eq-panel-twfe-fixeff-def}
where $\bF$ is a matrix of 0s and 1s are called *fixed effects* or *random intercept* models

:::

</div>

. . .

- Fixed effects and random intercepts — usually means the same
- <span class="highlight">Random intercepts</span> — less ambiguous

#### Examples of Model ([-@eq-panel-twfe-fixeff-def])

 
- Individual fixed effects/intercepts (one-way)
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \bX_i'\bbeta + U_{it}
$$
- Two-way models (time and individual effects):
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \bX_i'\bbeta + U_{it}
$$
- Can include more complicated effects, see empirical illustration (where $i$ — US counties, $t$ — quarters; effects — county-season and state-year)

### Fixed Effect (Within) Estimators {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}
   

#### Estimation Strategies

Suppose $\E[U_{it}|\bX_i]=0$. How to estimate parameters of Model ([-@eq-panel-twfe-fixeff-def])?

. . . 

<br>

There are two main strategies:

- Estimate including $\bF$ and $\bX$ as regressors — <span class="highlight">least squares dummy  variable</span> (LSDV) 
- Get rid of $\bF$ — <span class="highlight">within transformation</span> 


#### LSDV Estimation

LSDV — simply regress $\bY$ on $(\bF, \bX)$:
$$
(\hat{\bLambda}, \hat{\bbeta}^{LSDV}) = \argmin_{\bL, \bb} \norm{\bY - \bF\bL -\bX\bb  }_2^2
$$

. . . 

For example with two-way effects:

$$\small
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\hat{\alpha}_1, \dots, \hat{\alpha}_N, \hat{\gamma}_1, \dots, \hat{\gamma}_T, \hat{\bbeta}^{LSDV} \right)\\
& = \argmin_{a_1, \dots, a_N, g_1, \dots, g_T, \bb}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T \left(Y_{it} - a_i - g_t - \bX_{it}'\bb \right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Within Estimation I: One-Way Transformation
<!-- 
Within transformations <span class="highlight">eliminate </span> fixed effects (=$\bF$)

. . . 

<br> -->

First consider one-way model $Y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \bX_{it}' + U_{it}$. For $\bW_{it} = Y_{it}, \bX_{it}, U_{it}$, define the (one-way) <span class="highlight">within-transformed</span> version of $W_{it}$ as
$$ \small
\tilde{W}_{it} = W_{it} - \dfrac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T W_{it}
$$

. . . 

Within transformation <span class="highlight">eliminated </span> fixed effects (=$\bF$)
$$ \small
\tilde{Y}_{it} = \tilde{\bX}_{it}'\bbeta + \tilde{U}_{it}
$$





#### Within Estimation II: Two-Way Transformations

Suppose $Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \bX_{it}'\bbeta + U_{it}$. Define (two-way) <span class="highlight">within-transformed</span> variables as 
$$
\tilde{W}_{it} = W_{it} - \dfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T W_{it} - \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N W_{it} + \dfrac{1}{NT} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T W_{it}
$$

. . . 

Again <span class="highlight">eliminated </span> fixed effects (=$\bF$)
$$ \small
\tilde{Y}_{it} = \tilde{\bX}_{it}'\bbeta + \tilde{U}_{it}
$$

::: footer

Can find the matrix formula in section 3.2 of @Baltagi2021EconometricAnalysisPanel

:::

#### More General Within Transformation

<div class="rounded-box">

Consider general model: 
$$ \small
\bY = \bF\bLambda + \bX\bbeta + \bU
$$

There exists a linear transformation that eliminate $\bF$:
$$ \small
\tilde{\bY} = \tilde{\bX}\bbeta + \tilde{\bU}
$$ 

</div>
Call this the FWL or the (generalized) <span class="highlight">within </span> transformation

::: footer

Transformations — just application of the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell ("anatomy of regression") theorem. See E1a in @Wooldridge2020IntroductoryEconometricsModern

:::

#### Within Estimation

Within estimation: just regressing $\tilde{\bY}$ on $\tilde{\bX}$ with OLS:
$$
\hat{\bbeta}^{W} = \argmin_{\bb} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^N (\tilde{Y}_{it} - \tilde{\bX}_{it}'\bb)^2
$$

- $\tilde{\bX}$ must have maximum column rank (no collinearity in transformed regressors)
- Intuition in one-way case (only $\alpha_i$): some variation in $\bX_{it}$ over time 
  
#### Equivalence of Approaches



<div class="rounded-box">

::: {#prp-panel-twfe-equivalence-lsdv-w}

$$
\hat{\bbeta}^{LSDV} = \hat{\bbeta}^{W}
$$


:::
 
</div>


- Same results for $\bbeta$ from both approaches
- Not examinable: proof is a consequence of Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem [E1a in @Wooldridge2020IntroductoryEconometricsModern]
 

#### Which Approach to Use?

When to use LSDV vs. within estimation? 

- LSDV: only when you care about $\Lambda$ and they have some economic meaning. Example: $\alpha_i$ is the innate skill of worker $i$ [@delaRoca2017LearningWorkingBig]
- Within: in all other cases

. . . 

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}

Sometimes impossible to compute LSDV estimator: number of fixed effects is too large to even simply store the data matrix: 

- Called the "high-dimensional" fixed effect case
- In practice the within transformation is cleverly done indirectly [@Correia2016FeasibleEstimatorLinear]
:::

#### Pooled OLS 

<br> 

Another special case of model ([-@eq-panel-twfe-fixeff-def]) — <span class="highlight"> pooled OLS</span>:

- No fixed effects, directly regressing $Y_{it}$ on $\bX_{it}$
- Fully ignoring the panel structure
- Involves no transformations and no $\bF$
- Interpretation: the *least flexible* example of  ([-@eq-panel-twfe-fixeff-def])

Can apply to our problem


#### About Terminology: FE vs. RE vs. CRE




::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}

This terminology is confusing. Best to always say what you mean (e.g. "no restriction on the dependence between $\bbeta_i$ and $\bX_{it}$" or "random intercept")

Start a bit different — with an estimator and understanding what it does

For historic reasons --- estimators came first, people started actually thinking about the meaning more recently
