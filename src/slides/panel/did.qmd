### Empirical Motivation {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}

#### Context {#sec-event-study-svb-example}

 
@Card1994MinimumWagesEmployment
 

#### Empirical Question {.scrollable}

<div class="rounded-box">

Does raising the minimum wage reduce employment? 

 
</div>
 

## 2x2 Design {background="#00100F"}


#### Motivation

Previous lecture — "event studies" with "no trends" in average untreated outcome: $\E[Y_{it}^0]$ does not depend on $t$
 
<br>
 
<div class="rounded-box">

Assumption of no trends <span class="highlight">difficult to justify</span> unless time horizon very short 

</div>

- If there are trends, event studies do not work
- What can we do?
 

### Two-Unit Thought Experiment {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}

#### Setting: Two Units with Binary Treatment

To start: very simplified case

- Two periods of time: $t=1, 2$
- Two units: unit 1 with outcomes $Y$ and unit 2 with outcome $Z$
- Second unit treated between $t=1$ and $t=2$. First unit not treated

. . .

Potential outcomes at time $t$: $Y_t^d$ and $Z_t^d$ for treatment values $d=0, 1$

#### Object of Interest 

<br>

Object of interest: <span class="highlight">treatment effect</span> of unit 2 at $t=2$:
$$
\delta_Z = Z_2^1- Z_2^0
$$


#### Change in Outcomes

Observed outcomes satisfy
$$
Z_{1} = Z_1^0, \quad Z_{2} = Z_{2}^1
$$

. . .

Difference in outcomes (like in event studies):
$$
\begin{aligned}
Z_2 - Z_1 & = \gamma_T + \delta_T\\
\gamma_T & = Z_{2}^0 - Z_{1}^0
\end{aligned}
$$
$\gamma_T$ — trend in outcomes without treatment

#### Role of Assumptions of No Trends

Strict no trends assumption from previous lecture:
$$
\gamma_T = 0
$$ {#eq-panel-did-no-trends}

. . .

- Under ([-@eq-panel-did-no-trends]) $Z_2-Z_1=\delta_T$ — identification of treatment effect
- Without ([-@eq-panel-did-no-trends]) change in outcome — sum of treatment effect and evolution over time
- Hard to justify ([-@eq-panel-did-no-trends]) outside of high-frequency data

#### Trend for Other Unit

Outcomes of other unit satisfy:
$$
Y_1 = Y_1^0, \quad Y_2 = Y_2^0
$$


. . .

<br> 

Difference in outcomes: only trend in outcomes without treatment
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_2 - Y_1 & = \gamma_U\\
\gamma_U & = Y_2^0 - Y_1^0
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Parallel Trends 

Difference in differences of outcomes of units:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(Z_2- Z_1) - (Y_2- Y_1) = \delta_T + (\gamma_T - \gamma_U)
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

<br>

What if the two units had the same evolution? 
<div class="rounded-box">

**Assumption** (*literal parallel trends*):
$$
\gamma_T = \gamma_U
$$

</div>

#### Difference-in-Differences with Two Units

Under parallel trends identify $\delta_T$ as 
$$
\delta_T = (Z_2- Z_1) - (Y_2- Y_1)
$$ 

- Differences two unit-specific differences — hence called difference-in-difference<span class="highlight">s</span>
- Old argument, goes back at least to @Snow1856ModeCommunicationCholera

 

### Differences-in-Differences {background="#43464B" visibility="uncounted"}

#### Limitations of Two Unit Approach

Two unit situation might be

- Unrealistic: literal parallel trends might not hold
- Uninteresting: if you want to predict the effect for a new unit

. . .

<br>

$\Rightarrow$ Now consider an approach with <span class="highlight">multiple</span> units


#### Setting

- Units indexed by $i=1, \dots, N$, time indexed by $t=1, 2$
- All outcomes labeled $Y_{it}$
- Treatment pattern: realized treatment indicator $D_{it}$
  - Untreated/control group (group $U$): $D_{i1}=D_{i2}=0$
  - Treated group (group $T$): $D_{i1}=0$, $D_{i2}=1$

#### Potential Outcomes

Potential outcomes $Y_{it}^d$ for $d=0, 1$

- Units in group $T$:
$$
Y_{i1} = Y_{i1}^0, \quad Y_{i2} = Y_{i2}^1
$$
- Units in group $U$ 
$$
Y_{i1} = Y_{i1}^0, \quad Y_{i2}= Y_{i2}^0
$$

#### Change in Outcomes for Treated

Decompose average of $Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}$ for treated units ($T$):
$$
\E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1}|T] = \E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0|T]  + \E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0|T]
$$

- $\E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0|T]$ — parameter of interest, the <span class="highlight">average treatment effect for the treated</span> (ATT)
- $\E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0|T]$ trend in outcomes without treatment

#### Change in Outcomes for Untreated

<br>

For untreated units ($U$):
$$
\E[Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}|U] = \E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0|U]
$$

<br>

Only the time trend is present

#### Parallel Trends Assumption

Same trends on average:
<div class="rounded-box">

**Assumption** (*average parallel trends*):
$$
\E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0|T] = \E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0|U] 
$$

</div>
 

Then <span class="highlight">difference-in-differences</span> 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0|T] & = \E[Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}|T] - \E[Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}|U] 
\end{aligned}
$$
Expressed ATT in terms of distribution of the data

#### Result Statement

<div class="rounded-box">
 

::: {#prp-causal-did-att-canonical}

## DiD Identification

Suppose that $P(D_{i1}=D_{i2} =0)>0$ and $P(D_{i1}=0, D_{i2}=1)>0$. 

Then the ATT is $\E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0|T]$ is identified in terms of a difference in differences:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0|T] & = \E[Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}|T] - \E[Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}|U] 
\end{aligned}
$$

</div>

<br> 

Assumption means that both treated and untreated units exist

#### Discussion

What does DiD actually do? 

- Solves selection in treatment by
  - Considering effects only for the treated (ATT instead of ATE$=\E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i2}^0]$)
  - Compares treated units to themselves
- Solves evolution over time by
  - Assuming parallel trends without treatment
  - Identifies trend from untreated unit

#### Comments

As with event studies: underlying causal model and identification is nonparametric — linearity is not an assumption
