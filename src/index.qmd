# Advanced Econometrics (Econometrics II)



<img src="images/ecm-2-header-img.png" alt="Advanced Econometrics" style="width: 100%;  border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;">


Advanced Econometrics builds on the basic econometrics course in three directions. First, the course discusses a range of practical methods used in economics and business. Second, it addresses both causal inference and forecasting. Third, it offers a deeper discussion of the underlying theory.

## Course Content
 
  
### Content 


The course is structured as follows (subject to change):

1. A deeper look at linear regression:
   - A vector-matrix form approach to linear regression.
   - Basics of identification analysis. 
   - Asymptotic theory for the OLS estimator.
2. Asymptotic inference:
   - Refresher: key definitions and intuition of hypothesis testing.
   - Tests for linear hypotheses: $t$- and Wald tests.
   - The delta method and nonlinear Wald tests.

3. Panel data in causal settings:
   - Event studies.
   - Differences-in-differences.
   - Two-way fixed effect approaches with multivalued treatment.
   - Mean group estimation.
4. Introduction to forecasting:
   - Causal inference vs. forecasting I.
   - Notions of forecast optimality.
   - Forecasting in cross-sections.
5. Parametric nonlinear models:
   - Beyond linearity: nonlinear regression and nonlinear least squares.
   - Discrete outcomes in causal settings. 
   - Elements of asymptotic theory for nonlinear models.
   - Classification as forecasting with discrete outcomes.

If time allows, we will further discuss:

6. Generalized method of moments.
   - Linear generalized method of moments (GMM).
   - IV estimation of dynamic panel data models.
   - Fundamentals of nonlinear GMM.
7.  Time series:
    - Time series as probabilistic objects and their properties.
    - Univariate models: ARIMA(X).
    - Multivariate time series: VARIMA(X).
    - Elements of causal inference with time series. 
    - Forecasting with time series vs. forecasting with panel data

Even further topics such as quantile regression, experimentation under interference, and high-dimensional data may be introduced as time allows.
