# Advanced Econometrics (Econometrics II)



<img src="images/ecm-2-header-img.png" alt="Advanced Econometrics" style="width: 100%;  border-radius: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;">


Advanced Econometrics builds on the basic econometrics course in three directions. First, the course discusses a range of practical methods used in economics and business. Second, it addresses both causal inference and forecasting. Third, it offers a deeper discussion of the underlying theory.

### Content 
The course is structured into the following main parts (*Subject to modification based on progress*):

1. A deeper look at linear regression and linear IV:
   - A vector-matrix form approach to linear regression.
   - Asymptotic theory for the OLS estimator. Wald tests.
   - Linear generalized method of moments (GMM).
2. Panel data in causal settings:
   - Event studies.
   - Differences-in-differences.
   - Two-way fixed effect approaches with multivalued treatment.
   - Mean group estimation.
3. Introduction to forecasting:
   - Causal inference vs. forecasting I.
   - Notions of forecast optimality.
   - Forecasting in cross-sections.
4. Time series:
   - Time series as probabilistic objects and their properties.
   - Univariate models: ARIMA(X).
   - Multivariate time series: VARIMA(X).
   - Elements of causal inference with time series. 
   - Forecasting with time series vs. forecasting with panel data.
5. Parametric nonlinear models:
   - Beyond linearity: nonlinear regression and nonlinear least squares.
   - Discrete outcomes in causal settings. 
   - Elements of asymptotic theory for nonlinear models.
   - Classification as forecasting with discrete outcomes.

Further topics may include quantile and distributional regression, big data, and experimentation in settings with interference.
