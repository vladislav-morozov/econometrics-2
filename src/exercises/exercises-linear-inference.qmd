## Theoretical Exercises 

 

### Testing Scalar Restrictions

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i.
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$, that $\E[U_i|\bX_i]=0$, that $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$ is invertible, and that $\E[U_i^2\bX_i\bX_i']$ has maximal rank.

1. Consider the hypotheses $H_0: \beta_k = c$ and $H_1: \beta_k\neq c$, where $\beta_k$ is the $k$th coordinate of the $\bbeta$ vector. Propose a consistent test for $H_0$ vs $H_1$ that has asymptotic size $\alpha$.
2. Now let $\ba\neq 0$ be some known constant vector of the same dimension as $\bbeta$. Consider the hypotheses $H_0: \ba'\bbeta = c$ and $H_1: \ba'\bbeta\neq c$. Propose a consistent $t$-test for $H_0$ vs $H_1$ that has asymptotic size $\alpha$.
3. Why do we require that $\ba\neq 0$ in the previous question?

In both cases remember to show that your test is consistent and has the desired asymptotic size. 
 
### Testing Several Linear Restrictions

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i.
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$, that $\E[U_i|\bX_i]=0$, that $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$ is invertible, and that $\E[U_i^2\bX_i\bX_i']$ has maximal rank.

Let $\bbeta = (\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p)$ with $p\geq 4$.
Consider the following two hypotheses on $\bbeta$:
$$
H_0: \begin{cases}
\beta_1 = 0, \\
\beta_2 - \beta_3 = 1, \\
\beta_2 = 4\beta_4 + 5,
\end{cases} \quad H_1: \text{at least one equality in $H_0$ fails}
$$
Propose a consistent test for $H_0$ vs. $H_1$ with asymptotic size $\alpha$. Show that the test possesses these properties. 
 
### Inference on a Nonlinear Function of Parameters

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i.
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$, that $\E[U_i|\bX_i]=0$, that $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$ is invertible, and that $\E[U_i^2\bX_i\bX_i']$ has maximal rank.

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i.
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$, that $\E[U_i|\bX_i]=0$, that $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$ is invertible, and that $\E[U_i^2\bX_i\bX_i']$ has maximal rank. Also suppose that $\bbeta$ has $p\geq 2$ components, that $\beta_1>0$ and $\beta_2>0$, and that you are interested in 
$$
\gamma = \sqrt{\beta_1\beta_2}.
$$

1. Construct a confidence interval for $\gamma$ with asymptotic coverage $(1-\alpha)$.
2. Consider $H_0: \gamma=1$ vs. $H_1:\gamma\neq 1$. Construct a consistent test for $H_0$ vs. $H_1$ with asymptotic size $\alpha$.

Remember to prove coverage, consistency, and size properties. 
 

### Consistency of the HC0 Asymptotic Variance Estimator

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the scalar covariate $X_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \beta X_i + U_i
$$ {#eq-exercises-inference-ex4-scalar-model}
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, X_i$, that $\E[U_i|X_i]=0$, that $\E[X_i^2]\neq 0$, and that $\E[U_i^2 X_i^2]$ exists. Let  $\hat{\beta}$ be the OLS estimator obtained by regressing $Y_i$ on $X_i$.


Recall the HC0 [@White1980HeteroskedasticityConsistentCovarianceMatrix] estimator for $\avar(\hat{\beta})$. In the scalar model ([-@eq-exercises-inference-ex4-scalar-model]) it is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\avar}(\hat{\beta}) & = \dfrac{  N^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{U_i}^2 X_i^2 }{  \left( N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2 \right)^2  }.
\end{aligned}
$$
Show that 
$$
\widehat{\avar}(\hat{\beta}) \xrightarrow{p} \avar(\hat{\beta}) \equiv \dfrac{ \E[U_i^2X_i^2]  }{\left(\E[X_i^2] \right)^2 }.
$$
State explicitly any additional moment assumptions you make. 
 

## Applied Exercises

Applied exercises are from @Wooldridge2020IntroductoryEconometricsModern. In all cases, use asymptotic $t$- and Wald tests with robust standard errors:

- C9 in chapter 4,
- C4 and C6 in chapter 5, 
- C8 in chapter 7.

For some more code examples and discussion, look at chapters 4, 5, 7 in @Heiss2024UsingPythonIntroductory
