# Exercises: Vector Linear Model and Asymptotics


## Theoretical Exercises 

### Regressing Fitted Values

Suppose that we observe data $(Y_1, \bX_1), \dots (Y_N, \bX_N)$. Let $\bY$ be the $N\times 1$ vector of outcomes, $\bX$ be the data matrix, and suppose that $\bX'\bX$ is invertible. 

Let the vector $\hat{\bY}$ of fitted values and the vector $\hat{\be}$ of errors be given by 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bY} & = \bX\hat{\bbeta},\\
\hat{\be} & = \bY- \hat{\bY},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\hat{\bbeta}$ is the OLS estimator. 

Find the OLS coefficient vector from

1. Regressing $\hat{Y}_i$ on $\bX_i$.
2. Regressing $\hat{e}_i$ on $\bX_i$.

In both cases, express the OLS estimator in terms of $\bY$ and $\bX$. Then express it in terms of $(Y_i, \bX_i)$, $i=1, \dots, N$.

### Inconsistency of OLS Despite Strict Exogeneity

Let $X_i$ and $Y_i$ be scalar variables. Let $X_i$ satisfy
$$
X_i = \begin{cases}
1, & i = 1, \\
0, & i > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

1. Suppose we have a sample of $N$ units: $(Y_1, X_1), \dots, (Y_N, X_N)$. Can we compute the OLS estimator? If yes, express the estimator in terms of $(Y_i, X_i)$, $i=1,\dots, N$. If not, explain why.
2. Suppose that $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^x = \beta x + U_i,
$$
where $Y_i^x$ is a potential outcome, $U_i$ is independent of $X_i$ with $\E[U_i]=0$. Why does the OLS estimator of $\beta$ not converge to $\beta$? In other words, which of the conditions of our consistency results fail?
3. Provide an informal empirical interpretation of the above data-generating process for $X_i$.

### Ratio Slope Estimator

Let $X_i$ and $U_i$ be scalar random variables. Suppose that $X_i$ satisfies $X_i\geq c>0$ for some $c$ (strictly positive and bounded away from 0). Let $Y_i$ be some outcome. Suppose that the following linear causal model holds: the potential outcome $Y_i^x$ is determined as
$$
Y_i^x = \beta x + U_i.
$$
The realized outcome $Y_i$ is determined as $Y_i = Y_i^{X_i}$.

Consider the following estimator for $\beta$:
$$
\tilde{\beta} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{Y_i}{X_i}.
$$

1. Propose conditions under which $\tilde{\beta}$ is consistent for $\beta$ and prove consistency.
2. Derive the asymptotic distribution of $\tilde{\beta}$.
3. Now suppose that the causal model allows heterogeneous effects:
$$
Y_i^x = \beta_i x + U_i.
$$
Under which conditions does $\tilde{\beta}$ consistently estimate $\E[\beta_i]$?
 
### Limit of the Ridge Estimator

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$. 

Define the ridge estimator $\tilde{\bbeta}$ as
$$
\tilde{\bbeta} = (\bX'\bX+ \lambda_N \bI_k)^{-1}\bX'\bY,
$$
where $\lambda_N$ is some non-negative number, $\bI_k$ is the $k\times k$ identity matrix, and we assume that $(\bX'\bX+ \lambda_N \bI_k)$ is invertible. 

1. Suppose that $\bX_i$ is scalar. Show that $\abs{\tilde{\bbeta}}\leq \abs{\hat{\bbeta}}$, where $\hat{\bbeta}$ is the OLS estimator (in words, the ridge estimator is always weakly closer to 0 than the OLS estimator â€” it is "shrunk" to zero).
2. Suppose that $\lambda_N = cN$ for some fixed $c\geq 0$. Find the probability limit of $\tilde{\bbeta}$. State explicitly any moment assumptions you make. 
3. *(Optional)*: prove that ridge estimator satisfies
$$
\tilde{\bbeta} = \argmin_{\bb} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \bX_i'\bb)^{2} + \lambda \norm{\bb}^2
$$
Hint: use the same approach as we used to derive the OLS estimator. 
  

Why would one use $\tilde{\bbeta}$? Note that $\bX'\bX + c\bI_k$ is invertible if $c>0$, regardless of invertibility of $\bX'\bX$. This means that $\tilde{\bbeta}$ can be computed even if the OLS estimator cannot. A leading case is *high-dimensional* regression, where the number of regressors $k$ exceeds the number $N$ of data points. See section 6.2.1 in @James2023IntroductionStatisticalLearning about the ridge estimator and regularization techniques in general. We will discuss some of these ideas later in the class.

### Measurement Error Revisited

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i
$$
Suppose that our data is IID.


Suppose that we do not observe the true $Y_i$, but instead a mismeasured version $Y_i^*= Y_i + V_i$, where the measurement error $V_i$ is mean zero and independent from $(X_i, U_i)$. 

1. Show that the OLS estimator for the regression of $Y_i^*$ on $\bX_i$ is consistent for $\bbeta$.
2. Derive the asymptotic distribution of the above OLS estimator. Express the asymptotic variance in terms of moments involving $V_i$ and $U_i$. Interpret the result: how does the measurement error in $\bX$ affect the asymptotic variance of the OLS estimator?
