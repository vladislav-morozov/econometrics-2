# Exercises: Vector Linear Model and Asymptotics



## Regressing Fitted Values

Suppose that we observe data $(Y_1, \bX_1), \dots (Y_N, \bX_N)$. Let $\bX$ be the data matrix, and suppose that $\bX'\bX$ is invertible. 

Let the vector $\hat{\bY}$ of fitted values and the vector $\hat{\be}$ of errors be given by 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bY} = \bX\hat{\bbeta},
\hat{\be} = \bY- \hat{\bY},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\hat{\bbeta}$ is the OLS estimator. 

Find the OLS coefficient vector from

1. Regressing $\hat{Y}_i$ on $\bX_i$.
2. Regressing $\hat{e}_i$ on $\bX_i$.

In both cases, express the OLS estimator in terms of $\bY$ and $\bX$. Then express it in terms of $(Y_i, \bX_i)$, $i=1, \dots, N$.
