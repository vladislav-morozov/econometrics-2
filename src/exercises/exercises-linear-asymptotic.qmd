## Theoretical Exercises 

### Regressing Fitted Values

Suppose that we observe data $(Y_1, \bX_1), \dots (Y_N, \bX_N)$. Let $\bY$ be the $N\times 1$ vector of outcomes, $\bX$ be the data matrix, and suppose that $\bX'\bX$ is invertible. 

Let the vector $\hat{\bY}$ of fitted values and the vector $\hat{\be}$ of errors be given by 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bY} & = \bX\hat{\bbeta},\\
\hat{\be} & = \bY- \hat{\bY},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\hat{\bbeta}$ is the OLS estimator. 

Find the OLS coefficient vector from

1. Regressing $\hat{Y}_i$ on $\bX_i$.
2. Regressing $\hat{e}_i$ on $\bX_i$.

In both cases, express the OLS estimator in terms of $\bY$ and $\bX$. Then express it in terms of $(Y_i, \bX_i)$, $i=1, \dots, N$.

First consider the question of regressing $\hat{\bY}$ on $\bX$. Let $\tilde{\bbeta}$ be the OLS estimator of regressing $\hat{\bY}$ on $\bX$. We  can use the usual formula for the OLS, but replace $\bY$ with $\hat{\bY}$. We can then use the definition of $\hat{\bY}$ and $\hat{\bbeta}$ to express the coefficients in terms of the original data: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\bbeta} & = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\hat{\bY} = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\bX\hat{\bbeta} \\
& = \hat{\bbeta} = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX\bY = \left(\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i\bX_i' \right)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\bX_iY_i,
\end{aligned}
$$
One way to interpret the above result is that applying OLS more than 1 time does not change anything. The first application already extracts all the information that can be linearly explained by $\bX$ (a property sometimes called *idempotency*).

We can proceed similarly with $\hat{\be}$. Let $\check{\bbeta}$ be the OLS estimator for regressing $\hat{\bbeta}$ on $\bX$. We can again use the general expression for the OLS estimator and substitute the definition of $\hat{\bbeta}$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\check{\bbeta} & = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\hat{\be} = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'(\bY-\hat{\bY})\\
& = \hat{\bbeta} -\tilde{\bbeta} = \hat{\bbeta}- \hat{\bbeta}\\
& = 0,
\end{aligned}
$$
where we have used the first result of the problem.

### Inconsistency of OLS Despite Strict Exogeneity

Let $X_i$ and $Y_i$ be scalar variables. Let $X_i$ satisfy
$$
X_i = \begin{cases}
1, & i = 1, \\
0, & i > 1.
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-pset1-p2-x}

1. Suppose we have a sample of $N$ units: $(Y_1, X_1), \dots, (Y_N, X_N)$. Can we compute the OLS estimator for regressing $Y_i$ on $X_i$ (without a constant)? If yes, express the estimator in terms of $(Y_i, X_i)$, $i=1,\dots, N$. If not, explain why.
2. Suppose that $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^x = \beta x + U_i,
$$ {#eq-pset1-p2-causal}
where $Y_i^x$ is a potential outcome, $U_i$ is independent of $X_i$ with $\E[U_i]=0$. Why does the OLS estimator of $\beta$ not converge to $\beta$ without stronger assumptions on $U_i$? Informally, which of the conditions of our consistency results fail?
3. Provide an informal empirical interpretation of the above data-generating process for $X_i$.

*First subquestion*: The computability of the OLS estimator is determined by one key question: is $\bX'\bX$ invertible? If $\bX'\bX$ is invertible, then the answer is positive. 

In this case, there is only one scalar covariate. $\bX'\bX$ is itself then scalar ($1\times 1$) and given by
$$
\bX'\bX = \sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2
$$
By @eq-pset1-p2-x, we have that $\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2=1$, which is invertible. It follows that we can compute $\hat{\beta}=(\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\bY$:
$$
\hat{\beta} = (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\bY = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_iY_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2} = Y_1.
$$ {#eq-pset1-p2-beta}

<br>

*Second subquestion:* To answer this question formally, we use the same technique we use in the lectures --- substituting the underlying model into the estimator. By @eq-pset1-p2-causal, the realized outcomes satisfy
$$
Y_i = \beta X_i + U_i
$$

We substitute this expression for realized values into the OLS estimator ([-@eq-pset1-p2-beta]) to obtain
$$
\hat{\beta} = \beta + U_1,
$$
where we have used that $X_1 =1$ by @eq-pset1-p2-x.

We now see that the value of $\hat{\beta}$ does not depend on sample size $N$. The full value of $U_1$ will always be present in $\hat{\beta}$: as $N\to\infty$
$$
\hat{\beta} \xrightarrow{p} \beta + U_1
$$
The only case where $\hat{\beta}\xrightarrow{p}\beta$ is when $U_1=0$ --- an additional stronger condition.

Which conditions of our consistency results fail? There are two conditions that hold:

- Orthogonality: $\E[X_iU_i] =0$ holds. 
- Independence of units

There are two conditions that do not hold:

- Identical distributions: unit 1 is different to the rest. 
- Invertibility of the limit of $N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\bX_i\bX_i'$. By @eq-pset1-p2-x, this sum is equal to $N^{-1}\to 0$.

Of these two failing conditions, the first one is usually not a big issue. It concerns only a single point, and in general we have tools for handling non-identical distributions. 
It is the second condition that creates a problem in the limit. 

The message of this problem is that we make two invertibility conditions: the sample condition (on $\bX'\bX$) and the population one (on $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$). These conditions play different roles. Each can fail, while the other condition is true.

<br>

*Third subquestion*: we can imagine a simple experiment in which the subjects have arrived to the lab in a random order, independently of their characteristics. However, there is only one real treatment, which is given to the first unit. Everyone else receives a placebo.

### Ratio Slope Estimator

Let $X_i$ and $U_i$ be scalar random variables. Suppose that $X_i$ satisfies $X_i\geq c>0$ for some $c$ (strictly positive and bounded away from 0). Let $Y_i$ be some outcome. Suppose that the following linear causal model holds: the potential outcome $Y_i^x$ is determined as
$$
Y_i^x = \beta x + U_i.
$$ {#eq-pset1-p3-causal}
The realized outcome $Y_i$ is determined as $Y_i = Y_i^{X_i}$.

Consider the following estimator for $\beta$:
$$
\tilde{\beta} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{Y_i}{X_i}.
$$ 

1. Propose conditions under which $\tilde{\beta}$ is consistent for $\beta$ and prove consistency.
2. Derive the asymptotic distribution of $\tilde{\beta}$.
3. Now suppose that the causal model allows heterogeneous effects:
$$
Y_i^x = \beta_i x + U_i.
$$ {#eq-pset1-p3-causal-het}
Under which conditions does $\tilde{\beta}$ consistently estimate $\E[\beta_i]$?


<details>
  <summary>Click to see the solution</summary>


*First subquestion*: we again use the key technique --- substituting the true model into the estimator. By @eq-pset1-p3-causal, the outcome $Y_i$ satisfies
$$
Y_i = \beta X_i + U_i.
$$
We can substitute this expression into $\tilde{\beta}$ to obtain
$$
\tilde{\beta} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{Y_i}{X_i} = \beta+ \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i}
$$
The law of large number applies to the sum on the right hand side if 

1. $(X_i, U_i)$ are IID.
2. $\E[U_i/X_i]$ exists.

We make these assumptions. Then by the law of large numbers:
$$
\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i}\xrightarrow{p} \E\left[ \dfrac{U_i}{X_i} \right].
$$
By the continuous mapping theorem:
$$
\tilde{\beta} \xrightarrow{p} \beta + \E\left[ \dfrac{U_i}{X_i} \right].
$$
$\tilde{\beta}$ is consistent for $\beta$ if 

3. $\E[U_i/X_i]=0$ (note that it is sufficient that $\E[U_i|X_i]=0$ for this condition, why?).

We conclude that $\tilde{\beta}$ is consistent for $\beta$ under assumptions (1)-(3).


<br>

*Second subquestion*: to study the asymptotic distribution, we keep the above conditions (1)-(3). Under these conditions (especially (3)) we note that 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\beta} - \beta & = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i} \\
& = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i} - \E\left[\dfrac{U_i}{X_i}\right].
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pset1-p3-sampling-error}
The bottom line is in the form used in the central limit theorem: sample average minus population average. We can then apply the central limit theorem provided the following assumption holds:

4. Finite second moments: $\E[U_i^2/X_i^2]<\infty$.

Then by the central limit theorem it holds that 
$$
\sqrt{N}\left(  \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i} - \E\left[\dfrac{U_i}{X_i}\right] \right)\xrightarrow{d} N\left(0, \E\left[\dfrac{U_i^2}{X_i^2} \right] \right).
$$

By @eq-pset1-p3-sampling-error we conclude that, if assumptions (1)-(4) hold, then
$$
\sqrt{N}\left(\tilde{\beta}- \beta \right)\xrightarrow{d} N\left(0, \E\left[\dfrac{U_i^2}{X_i^2} \right] \right).
$$

<br>

*Third subquestion*: we again start by substituting the causal model into the estimator. Under @eq-pset1-p3-causal-het the outcome satisfies
$$
Y_i = \beta_i X_i + U_i.
$$
Then $\tilde{\beta}$ can be written as
$$
\tilde{\beta} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \beta_i +  \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{U_i}{X_i}.
$$ {#eq-pset1-p3-sampling-error-het}
The second sum in @eq-pset1-p3-sampling-error-het can be handled as in the first subquestion using assumptions (1)-(3). The first sum satisfies
$$
 \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \beta_i  \xrightarrow{p} \E[\beta_i]
$$
by the law of large numbers provided

5. $\E[\beta_i]$ exists.

We conclude by the continuous mapping theorem (where do we apply it?) that $\tilde{\beta}$ is consistent for $\E[\beta_i]$ under conditions (1)-(3) and (5).

Note that this consistency result does not restrict the dependence between $\beta_i$ and $X_i$. This is in contrast to the behavior of the OLS estimator (see lectures).

### Limit of the Ridge Estimator

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i
$$
Suppose that we observe an IID sample of data on $Y_i, \bX_i$. 

Define the ridge estimator $\tilde{\bbeta}$ as
$$
\tilde{\bbeta} = (\bX'\bX+ \lambda_N \bI_k)^{-1}\bX'\bY,
$$
where $\lambda_N$ is some non-negative number, $\bI_k$ is the $k\times k$ identity matrix, and we assume that $(\bX'\bX+ \lambda_N \bI_k)$ is invertible. 

1. Suppose that $\bX_i$ is scalar. Show that $\abs{\tilde{\bbeta}}\leq \abs{\hat{\bbeta}}$, where $\hat{\bbeta}$ is the OLS estimator (in words, the ridge estimator is always weakly closer to 0 than the OLS estimator — it is "shrunk" to zero).
2. Suppose that $\lambda_N = cN$ for some fixed $c\geq 0$. Find the probability limit of $\tilde{\bbeta}$. State explicitly any moment assumptions you make. When is $\tilde{\bbeta}$ consistent for $\bbeta$?
3. *(Optional)*: prove that ridge estimator satisfies
$$
\tilde{\bbeta} = \argmin_{\bb} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \bX_i'\bb)^{2} + \lambda \norm{\bb}^2
$$
Hint: use the same approach as we used to derive the OLS estimator.

*First subquestion*: in the scalar case we can write both estimators as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bbeta} & = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i Y_i }{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2},\\
\tilde{\bbeta} & = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i Y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2 + \lambda_N}.
\end{aligned}
$$
We can then divide the ridge estimator by the OLS estimator:
$$
\dfrac{\tilde{\bbeta}}{\hat{\bbeta}} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2}{ \sum_{i=1}^N X_i^2 + \lambda_N } \leq 1.
$$
The desired inequality follows.

<br>

*Second subquestion*: for the second subquestion, we again start by substituting the model into the estimator:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\bbeta} & = (\bX'\bX+ \lambda_N \bI_k)^{-1}\bX'\bY\\
& = \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i\bX_i' + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_iY_i\\
& = \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i\bX_i' + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i\bX_i'\bbeta\\
& \quad + \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i\bX_i' + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i U_i
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pset1-p4-sampling-error}
We now only need to handle the individual averages in the above expression. 

First, we assume that 

- $\E[\bX_i\bX_i']$ and $\E[\bX_i'U_i]$ exist

Then by the law of large number it holds that
$$
\begin{aligned}
 \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i \bX_i' & \xrightarrow{p} \E[\bX_i\bX_i'], \\
 \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i U_i & \xrightarrow{p} \E[\bX_iU_i] . 
\end{aligned}
$$
By the continuous mapping theorem it also follows that
$$
 \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i \bX_i' + c\bI_i \xrightarrow{p} \E[\bX_i\bX_i'] + c\bI_k.
$$ {#eq-pset1-p4-leading-term}

Second, to handle the leading terms in @eq-pset1-p4-sampling-error, we also assume that

- $\E[\bX_i\bX_i'] + c\bI_k$ is invertible

Then by the continuous mapping theorem and  @eq-pset1-p4-leading-term it holds that 
$$
 \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \bX_i \bX_i' + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \xrightarrow{p} \left(\E[\bX_i\bX_i'] + c\bI_k\right)^{-1}.
$$

Combining the above arguments together and applying the continuous mapping theorem, we conclude that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\bbeta} & \xrightarrow{p}  \left(\E[\bX_i\bX_i'] + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \E[\bX_i\bX_i']\bbeta
\\
& \quad +  \left(\E[\bX_i\bX_i'] + c\bI_k\right)^{-1} \E[\bX_iU_i].
\end{aligned}
$$
We conclude that $\tilde{\bbeta}$ is consistent for $\bbeta$ if $c=0$ and $\E[\bX_iU_i]=0$.






<br>

</details>

Why would one use $\tilde{\bbeta}$? Note that $\bX'\bX + c\bI_k$ is invertible if $c>0$, regardless of invertibility of $\bX'\bX$. This means that $\tilde{\bbeta}$ can be computed even if the OLS estimator cannot. A leading case is *high-dimensional* regression, where the number of regressors $k$ exceeds the number $N$ of data points. See section 6.2.1 in @James2023IntroductionStatisticalLearning about the ridge estimator and regularization techniques in general. We will discuss some of these ideas later in the class.

### Measurement Error Revisited

Let the outcome $Y_i$, the covariates $\bX_i$, and an unobserved component $U_i$ be linked through the linear causal model
$$
Y_i^{\bx} = \bx'\bbeta + U_i
$$
Suppose that our data is IID.


Suppose that we do not observe the true $Y_i$, but instead a mismeasured version $Y_i^*= Y_i + V_i$, where the measurement error $V_i$ is mean zero and independent of $(X_i, U_i)$. 

1. Show that the OLS estimator for the regression of $Y_i^*$ on $\bX_i$ is consistent for $\bbeta$.
2. Derive the asymptotic distribution of the above OLS estimator. Express the asymptotic variance in terms of moments involving $V_i$ and $U_i$. Interpret the result: how does the measurement error in $\bX$ affect the asymptotic variance of the OLS estimator (increase, decrease, unchanged, unclear)? 

Now suppose that we do observe $Y_i$, but we do not observe $\bX_i$. Instead, we only see a mismeasured version $\bX_i^*= \bX_i + \bV_i$, where the measurement error $\bV_i$ is mean zero and independent of $(\bX_i, U_i)$. 

3. Compute the limit of the OLS estimator in the regression of $Y_i$ on $\bX_i^*$. Is this estimator consistent for $\bbeta$? If so, under which conditions?

Compare the two cases of measurement error.



### Omitted Variable Bias Revisited

Let $Y_i$ be some outcome of interest. Let $\bX_i$ be an observed covariate vector. Let $U_i$ be an unobserved component that satisfies $\E[\bX_iU_i]=0$. Let $\bW_i$ be another group of variables that affect $Y_i$. Suppose that $Y_i$ and $(\bX_i, \bW_i)$ are related through the potential outcomes model
$$
Y_i^{(\bx, \bw)} = \bx'\bbeta + \bw'\bdelta + U_i.
$$ 

Suppose that $\bW_i$ is not observed, and we instead regress $Y_i$ only on $\bX_i$. Find the probability limit of the corresponding OLS estimator. When is that limit equal to $\bbeta$? If $\bX_i$ is scalar, can you say anything about the direction of the bias?
